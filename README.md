# ThrowStrings

ThrowStrings is sample solution that demonstrates that .NET CLR allows also throwing of other types and not only exceptions. Solution contains two examples:

1. Pure IL - sample code in pure IL that is built using ilasm.exe
2. ThrowStrings solution - Visual Studio project with some parts written in IL

For Visual Studio solution [IL Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ins0mniaque.ILSupport) extension from Visual Studio marketplace is needed.

# Support materials

ThrowStrings solution is based on these writings by me:

* [Writing IL code on Visual Studio](http://gunnarpeipman.com/2018/01/il-visual-studio/)
* [IL perversions: throwing and catching strings](http://gunnarpeipman.com/2010/02/il-perversions-throwing-and-catching-strings/)

# Warning

All code here is experimental.
